# Markus Eger's Repositories

I am a researcher working on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, mostly applied to video games. In my public repositories below you can find, among other things:

- A project for the extraction of information from hearthstone replays, and how to use it to predict deck archetypes using RNNs and statistical methods ([repository](https://github.com/yawgmoth/HSPrediction))
- Two implementations of the game Hanabi, for the development of different AI methods ([python](https://github.com/yawgmoth/pyhanabi), [Haskell](https://github.com/yawgmoth/Hanabi))
- A macro-system for Dynamic Epistemic Logic to write epistemic actions succinctly, implemented in Haskell ([repository](https://github.com/yawgmoth/Ostari))
- Some basic Unity demos/labs I used for my class on game development ([2D Demo](https://github.com/yawgmoth/UnityDemo2D), [3D Demo](https://github.com/yawgmoth/UnityDemo), [Random Tricks](https://github.com/yawgmoth/UnityTricks), [detailed descriptions](https://yawgmoth.github.io/CI-2807/labs))
- An implementation of the game Dominion, with a Monte Carlo Tree Search based agent ([repository](https://github.com/yawgmoth/Dominion))
- An implementation of the game 6 Nimmt!, with several baseline AI agents ([repository](https://github.com/yawgmoth/6nimmt))
- A turn-based tactics game, written in PyGame ([repository](https://github.com/yawgmoth/Skvadron))
- A game vaguely inspired by the game Kingdom Builder, written in PyGame ([repository](https://github.com/yawgmoth/kingdombuilder))
